## ðŸ˜´ Sleep Stress Analyzer Bot ðŸ¤–
- [Sleep Stress Analyzer Bot](https://github.com/RoshanR-Git/Sleep-Stress-Analyzer-Bot)

**Description:**  
A machine learning-based application that predicts **stress levels** from sleep patterns and lifestyle factors. The bot is powered by a **Random Forest Regressor**, which provides accurate predictions by analyzing user data such as sleep duration, quality, and habits.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
1. Uses **Random Forest Regressor** for stress level prediction  
2. Analyzes **sleep patterns, duration, and lifestyle inputs**  
3. Provides **personalized stress insights**  
4. Interactive bot interface for a **user-friendly experience**  

**Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Streamlit, Random Forest Regressor

## ðŸ©º Diabetes Predictor Bot ðŸ¤–
- [Diabetes Predictor Bot](https://github.com/RoshanR-Git/Diabetes-Predicter-Bot)

**Description:**  
A machine learning-powered application that predicts the **risk of diabetes** based on health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more. The bot leverages a **Logistic Regression model** to provide a probability of being diabetic or non-diabetic.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
1. Uses **Logistic Regression** for binary classification (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)  
2. Takes in **health parameters** (Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.)  
3. Provides **probability-based predictions**  
4. Simple and **interactive interface** for users  

**Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Streamlit
