## 🩺 Diabetes Predictor Bot 🤖
- [Diabetes Predictor Bot](https://github.com/RoshanR-Git/Diabetes-Predicter-Bot)

**Description:**  
A machine learning-powered application that predicts the **risk of diabetes** based on health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more. The bot leverages a **Logistic Regression model** to provide a probability of being diabetic or non-diabetic.

### 🔑 Key Features:
1. Uses **Logistic Regression** for binary classification (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)  
2. Takes in **health parameters** (Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.)  
3. Provides **probability-based predictions**  
4. Simple and **interactive interface** for users  

**Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Streamlit

**Description:**  
A **Streamlit-based** machine learning web application that detects fraudulent online payment transactions.  
The model analyzes transaction details such as type, amount, balance changes, and flags potentially **fraudulent activities** using a trained **LightGBM model**.

### 🔑 Key Features:
1. Built with **Streamlit** for real-time fraud detection  
2. Uses a **LightGBM model** for high-accuracy predictions  
3. Takes multiple **transaction parameters** as input  
4. Displays **prediction results and confidence score**  
5. Simple UI for end-users to test transactions interactively  

**Tech Stack:** Python, LightGBM, pandas, joblib, Streamlit
